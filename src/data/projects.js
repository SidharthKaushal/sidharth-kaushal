          Our client faced several challenges with her previous platform. It didn’t provide enough flexibility and user engagement and didn’t fully reflect her brand anymore. The lack of essential features, such as analytics, made it difficult for her to make informed decisions. Despite these limitations, the platform was expensive, prompting our client to seek a more cost-effective and customizable solution that wouldn’t require ongoing payments.

          She also wanted the new app to clearly reflect her personal brand vision and values, helping her to reach a wider audience. Given that most of her users preferred mobile apps for their training, it was crucial for the new solution to be mobile-centric, ensuring ease of use on smartphones and tablets.
